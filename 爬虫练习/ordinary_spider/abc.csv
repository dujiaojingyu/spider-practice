<p>Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;

    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
    {
        // Primary loop
        for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        {
            if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; elapsedTime &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""sum = "" &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Without <code>std::sort(data, data + arraySize);</code>, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.</li>
<li>With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
        {
            // Primary loop
            for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            {
                if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(""sum = "" + sum);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.</p>

<hr>

<p>My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is going on?</li>
<li>Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?</li>

<p>Recently, I ran some of my JavaScript code through Crockford's <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">JSLint</a>, and it gave the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Problem at line 1 character 1: Missing ""use strict"" statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doing some searching, I realized that some people add <code>""use strict"";</code> into their JavaScript code. Once I added the statement, the error stopped appearing. Unfortunately, Google did not reveal much of the history behind this string statement. Certainly it must have something to do with how the JavaScript is interpreted by the browser, but I have no idea what the effect would be.</p>

<p>So what is <code>""use strict"";</code> all about, what does it imply, and is it still relevant?</p>

<p>This question attempts to collect the few pearls among the dozens of bad C++ books that are published every year.</p>

<p>Unlike many other programming languages, which are often picked up on the go from tutorials found on the Internet, few are able to quickly pick up C++ without studying a well-written C++ book. It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that <strong><em>there are very many very bad C++ books</em></strong> out there. And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting <em>glaringly obvious factual errors</em> and <em>promoting abysmally bad programming styles</em>.</p>

<p>Please edit the accepted answer to provide <strong>quality books</strong> and an approximate skill level — <em>preferably</em> <strong>after</strong> <em>discussing your addition in <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/10/loungec"">the C++ chat room</a></em>. (The regulars might mercilessly undo your work if they disagree with a recommendation.) Add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read/benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc. Books that meet the criteria will be added to the list.

<p>In other words, <code>POST</code> is used to <strong>create</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong><code>PUT</code></strong> method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied <code>Request-URI</code>.

<p>This question attempts to collect the few pearls among the dozens of bad C++ books that are published every year.</p>

<p>Unlike many other programming languages, which are often picked up on the go from tutorials found on the Internet, few are able to quickly pick up C++ without studying a well-written C++ book. It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that <strong><em>there are very many very bad C++ books</em></strong> out there. And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting <em>glaringly obvious factual errors</em> and <em>promoting abysmally bad programming styles</em>.</p>

<p>Please edit the accepted answer to provide <strong>quality books</strong> and an approximate skill level — <em>preferably</em> <strong>after</strong> <em>discussing your addition in <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/10/loungec"">the C++ chat room</a></em>. (The regulars might mercilessly undo your work if they disagree with a recommendation.) Add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read/benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc. Books that meet the criteria will be added to the list.  Books that have reviews by the Association of C and C++ Users (ACCU) have links to the review. </p>

<p>How do I force an overwrite of local files on a <code>git pull</code>?</p>

<p>The scenario is following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A team member is modifying the templates for a website we are working on</li>
<li>They are adding some images to the images directory (but forgets to add them under source control)</li>
<li>They are sending the images by mail, later, to me</li>
<li>I'm adding the images under the source control and pushing them to GitHub together with other changes</li>
<li>They cannot pull updates from GitHub because Git doesn't want to overwrite their files.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the error I'm getting:</p>

<pre><code>error: Untracked working tree file 'public/images/icon.gif' would be overwritten by merge
</code></pre>

<p>How do I force Git to overwrite them? The person is a designer - usually I resolve all the conflicts by hand, so the server has the most recent version that they just needs to update on their computer.</p>

<p>How come certain random strings produce colors when entered as background colors in HTML? For example:</p>

<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;body bgcolor=""chucknorris""&gt; test &lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Recently, I ran some of my JavaScript code through Crockford's <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">JSLint</a>, and it gave the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Problem at line 1 character 1: Missing ""use strict"" statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doing some searching, I realized that some people add <code>""use strict"";</code> into their JavaScript code. Once I added the statement, the error stopped appearing. Unfortunately, Google did not reveal much of the history behind this string statement. Certainly it must have something to do with how the JavaScript is interpreted by the browser, but I have no idea what the effect would be.</p>

<p>So what is <code>""use strict"";</code> all about, what does it imply, and is it still relevant?</p>

<p>Do any of the current browsers respond to the <code>""use strict"";</code> string or is it for future use?</p>

<p>I've recently started maintaining someone else's JavaScript code. I'm fixing bugs, adding features, and also trying to tidy up the code and make it more consistent.</p>

<p>The previous developer uses two ways of declaring functions and I can't work out if there is a reason behind it or not.</p>

<p>The two ways are:</p>

<pre><code>var functionOne = function() {
    // Some code
};
</code></pre>



<pre><code>function functionTwo() {
    // Some code
}
</code></pre>

<p>What are the reasons for using these two different methods and what are the pros and cons of each? Is there anything that can be done with one method that can't be done with the other?</p>
